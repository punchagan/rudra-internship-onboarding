# Git branches, basic Python, Pull requests

Goal: warm up basic Python coding, learn Git branch based workflow with pull requests.

## Tasks

- Create a new Git branch (e.g. task-3).

- In this subfolder add `basic_python.py` containing:

  - Function `reverse_string(s)` → returns the reversed string.
  - Function `mean(nums)` → returns the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers
  - A `__main__` block that:
    - prints an example string and its reversal,
    - prints a small number list and its mean.

- Commit only the new folder and script, push the branch, and open a pull request.

- In the PR description note time spent and anything you had to look up.
